# Z's Dress Up Flash Games

These are the original first and second editions of Z's Dress Up, written and designed in Flash 8. Originally published on DeviantART when I was 17, these games can now be found on the new SheezyArt today.

Dubbed "editions" (also known as 1E and 2E), each release introduced a new set of clothes that players could drag and drop onto the character. The initial design was inspired by Sims 2 Bodyshop, later known as Create-A-Sim, but I had to settle for drag-and-drop mechanics since I couldn’t figure out how to replicate the gameplay. This limitation led to the second edition having a larger resolution than the first, accommodating an expanded roster of items and outfits.

This archive also includes the initial draft of 3E, rewritten and designed in Flash CS5 (I refuse to use Adobe Creative Cloud). The goal of 3E was to unify and merge past editions into a single cohesive game while introducing new content as always. While successful, I realized that scrolling through items frame-by-frame—something reminiscent of Sims 1—could also be achieved in Godot. Unlike prior attempts to port the game to the new engine, 3E proved to be a faithful 1:1 rewrite of the Flash version designed in CS5.
