Tony's Dress Up is a re-imagining of my first (and only) Flash game series, ZC's Dress Up , developed back in 2007. Both this and the originals are heavily inspired by The Sims 2: Body Shop in their own unique ways.

I've included the original Flash releases in the ``/archive`` directory. They can be played using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)'s demo page.
