# Z's Dress Up Flash Games

This archive directory contains the original first and second editions of Z's Dress Up, written and designed in Flash 8. Originally published on DeviantART when I was 17, these games can now be found and planned from the new [SheezyArt](https://sheezy.art/tonytins/persona/zc456/gallery) today.

Dubbed "editions" (also known as 1E and 2E), each release introduced a new set of clothes that players could drag and drop onto the character. The initial design was inspired by Sims 2 Bodyshop, later known as Create-A-Sim, but I had to settle for drag-and-drop mechanics since I couldn’t figure out how to replicate the gameplay. This limitation led to the second edition having a larger resolution than the first to accommodate the expanded roster of items and outfits.

2E was the longest-running edition at the time, receiving updates as 2.5E in 2008 and even inspiring a Customs spin-off due to popular demand. While the game was very simple in both design and execution, its unintended popularity on DeviantART and the fact that it was my first functional game ever motivated me to pour countless hours into rewriting it in a more suitable game engine offered the potential for proper expansion that the original editions could only dream of achieving.

This archive also includes the initial draft of 3E, rewritten and designed in Flash CS5 (I refuse to use Adobe Creative Cloud). The goal of 3E was to unify and merge past editions into a single cohesive game while introducing new content as always. While successful, I realized that scrolling through items frame-by-frame—something reminiscent of Sims 1—could also be achieved in Godot. Unlike prior attempts to port the game to the new engine, 3E proved to be a faithful 1:1 rewrite of the Flash version designed in CS5.

These games owes their existence and was entirely inspired by Coshi Dragonite's [Dress Up Megawolf](https://www.deviantart.com/coshi-dragonite/art/Dress-up-Megawolf-45309110), a game that used the same drag-and-drop mechanics and was also published on DeviantART.
