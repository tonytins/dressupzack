# Zack's Dress Up

![Zack's Dress Up](./zcdressup.png)

An open source remaster of ZC's Dress Up, an old Flash game that I developed back in 2007. You can find and run the originals in ``/archives`` using the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) browser extension. Due to the nature of the technology, the flash games are not open source but they are abandonware.
